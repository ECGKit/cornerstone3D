Here are the breaking changes from the cornerstone 1.x to 2.x.


## Typescript Upgrade

We have upgraded the typescript version from 4.6 to 5.4 in the 2.0 version of the cornerstone3D.
This upgrade most likely don't require any changes in your codebase, but it is recommended to update the typescript version in your project to 5.4
to avoid any issues in the future.


## Decoders Update

`@cornerstonejs/dicomImageLoader` previously utilized the old API for web workers, which is now deprecated. It has transitioned to the new web worker API via the `comlink` package. This change enables more seamless interaction with web workers and facilitates compiling and bundling the web workers to match the ESM version of the library.


## Removing support for non-worker decoders

We have removed support for non-web worker decoders in the 2.0 version of the cornerstone3D. This change is to ensure that the library is more performant and to reduce the bundle size.
